# Link Monstera 

[A Link Tree Clone](https://linktr.ee/?&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=BAU_CA_Google_Search_Brand_Intent&utm_term=link%20tree&utm_content=BAU_CA_Google_Search_Brand_Intent_Linktree&gclid=CjwKCAiA5sieBhBnEiwAR9oh2n-7IL5JqKjlMDkc4wWPLIjFte_TPw2nUcSHPjEy9RLbttbV-92_fRoC-6UQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)

## Description 

Link Monstera recreates the Link Tree functionality. 

The app allows signed in users to add links under their profile. They can then share their Link Monstera url on social media or via email with their audience. 
Visitors cannot edit or post links unless they create an account on Link Monstera.

## Objective üèîÔ∏è
I like clones - cloning takes the pressure off of creating a new app and it allows me to practice what I know and learn new coding skills. 
Clones also prevent me from spending too much designing the appearance of my application and allows me to focus on its functionality. 

tldr:
-Used Supabase as a database and as an authenticator
-Exploring new libraries
-Creating a user-friendly, clean-coded and live application
